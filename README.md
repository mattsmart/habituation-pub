# Minimal motifs for habituating systems

Code for the paper ["Minimal motifs for habituating systems" (PNAS 2024)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409330121).

Habituation refers to the ubiquitous ability of organisms -- from animals to single cells -- to tune out repetitive stimuli. This repository implements and analyzes minimal dynamical systems exhibiting various hallmarks of habituation, including:

- Short-term response decrements
- Spontaneous recovery
- Dishabituation
- Frequency-dependent effects
- Long-term memory formation

## Dependencies
- Python >=3.9 with libraries listed in `requirements.txt`  
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Core implementation of habituation models and utilities
- `src/notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for reproducing figures and analysis
